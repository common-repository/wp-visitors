== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I donâ€™t like the way visitor details are displayed. Can I change it to meet my fantasies? =

Yes. If you know basic HTML and some PHP, you should be able to change it.

= What does the IP address link to in visitor details? =

It links to the ARIN WHOIS database and provides some more information that you may (not) find useful.

= #2 sounds fine. But I am a click-conservationalist. I want more information by default! =

Geographical resolution of IP address will be included in a subsequent update.

= It only says #### hits so far and following are recorded today. What if I want to check my visitors from some other day? =

Very valid question. Like #3, this feature will also be added in a subsequent update. 

== Screenshots ==

1. Once the plugin is installed, activated and some hits/page-loads have been recorded, visitor details look like this. If the screenshot does not show up for sme reason, please visit the Plugin Homepage.
